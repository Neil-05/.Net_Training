Scenario-Based Coding Problem: CampusHire Applicant Management System

Scenario:
CampusHire is a professional consultancy firm that assists fresh graduates in finding suitable job opportunities.
As part of their recruitment support process, CampusHire maintains applicant records containing personal, academic,
and job preference details. These records are managed internally by the CampusHire operations team.

To streamline this process, CampusHire requires a console-based application that allows their team to manage applicant
information efficiently and securely.

Problem Statement:
You are required to design and develop a .Net-based console application for CampusHire that enables the team to
register fresh graduates, manage their details, and persist applicant data for future access.

Each applicant registering with CampusHire must provide the following details:

• Applicant ID (Example: CH123456)  
• Applicant Name  
• Current Location (Mumbai / Pune / Chennai – select any one)  
• Preferred Job Location (Mumbai / Pune / Chennai / Delhi / Kolkata / Bangalore – select any one)  
• Core Competency (.NET / JAVA / ORACLE / Testing)  
• Passing Year (Degree completion year)

System Requirements:
1. The CampusHire team should be able to add new applicant records into the system.
2. All applicant records must be stored in a collection during runtime.
3. Applicant data must be persisted into a file using serialization so that data is retained between executions.
4. The system should provide functionality to:
  - Display all applicant details
  - Search for an applicant using Applicant ID
  - Update applicant details
  - Delete applicant records

Validation Rules:
The application must enforce the following validations:
1. All fields are mandatory and cannot be left blank.
2. Applicant ID must be exactly 8 characters long and should start with the prefix “CH”.
3. Applicant Name must contain a minimum of 4 characters and a maximum of 15 characters.
4. Passing Year must not be greater than the current year.

Expected Outcome:
By implementing this application, CampusHire will be able to efficiently manage applicant information,
ensure data consistency through validation rules, and securely store applicant records using file-based serialization.
